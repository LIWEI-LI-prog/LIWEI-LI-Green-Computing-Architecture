**Date:** November 27, 2025  
**Author:** LIWEI LI  
**Status:** Foundational Concept - A Clean-Slate Breakthrough

## 1. Core Principle: Rejecting Silicon Baseline

This architecture **fundamentally rejects the silicon CMOS process** as its foundation. Instead, it embraces a photocentric paradigm where **light is the native information carrier and computational medium.**

## 2. Manufacturing Philosophy: From Luminescent Materials

We abandon the path of "etching transistors in silicon" and pursue **"growing computational structures from light-emitting materials."**

### 2.1 Material Foundation: Gallium Nitride (GaN) Platform
- **Core Material:** III-V semiconductors, primarily Gallium Nitride
- **Why:** Native light-emitting capability (direct bandgap)
- **Form:** Epitaxial growth on various substrates (GaN-on-Si, GaN-on-Sapphire)

### 2.2 Process Node: Micron-Scale Luminescent Computing
- **Target:** Not nanometer transistor size, but **micron-scale photonic computational cells**
- **Metric:** Functional density per optical wavelength, not transistor count

## 3. Architectural Implementation: The Light-Native Stack

### 3.1 Computational Photonic Array (L4)
- **Composition:** Dense arrays of microscopic GaN LEDs
- **Function:** Each LED serves as both light source and computational element
- **Operation:** Optical intensity modulation for ternary state representation (-1, 0, +1)

### 3.2 Dynamic Photonic Network (L3)
- **Composition:** Active optical switches and routers
- **Technology:** Electro-optic modulators based on GaN
- **Function:** Real-time reconfiguration of light paths

### 3.3 Optical Memory Matrix (L2)
- **Technology:** Phase-change materials integrated with photonic elements
- **Operation:** Optical read/write operations using different wavelengths
- **Benefit:** True in-memory photonic computing

## 4. Revolutionary Advantages

### 4.1 Inherent Security
- **Electromagnetic Silence:** No electrical signals to intercept
- **Physical Isolation:** Optical confinement prevents external probing
- **Quantum-Safe:** Photonic information transfer resists classical eavesdropping

### 4.2 Ultimate Energy Efficiency
- **Native Light Processing:** Eliminates photoelectric conversion overhead
- **Parallel by Nature:** Wavelength division multiplexing for massive parallelism
- **Minimal Heat Generation:** Primary energy converts to light, not heat

## 5. Implementation Challenge Strategy

### 5.1 Immediate Path (2025-2026)
- Develop basic GaN photonic logic gates
- Demonstrate optical ternary full adder
- Create simulation framework for photonic architecture

### 5.2 Medium-term Goal (2026-2027)
- Integrate optical memory elements
- Demonstrate simple photonic neural network
- Establish open-source photonic design tools

### 5.3 Long-term Vision (2027+)
- Full photonic computing system
- Commercial-scale manufacturing partnerships
- New programming paradigm for photonic computing

## 6. Conclusion: A New Beginning

This report outlines a complete departure from semiconductor convention. We are not improving existing technology—we are **building the first native photonic computing infrastructure**, where computation emerges from the fundamental properties of light and luminescent materials.

The future of computing will not be measured in nanometers, but in **photonic computational density.**
