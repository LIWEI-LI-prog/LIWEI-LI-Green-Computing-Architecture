# LIWEI LI Green Computing Architecture - Technical Report

**Document Version:** v3.1  
**Last Updated:** December 19, 2025  
**Architecture Type:** Vertical Heterogeneous 3D Integration  
**Logic Paradigm:** Balanced Ternary (+1, 0, -1)  
**License:** Apache 2.0 (Open Layers), Proprietary (Integration Layer)

## Executive Summary

This report documents the technical specifications and development status of the LIWEI LI Green Computing Architecture as of December 2025. The architecture implements a **"4+1" stratified approach** that separates computational innovation (open-source layers L1-L4) from manufacturing integration challenges (proprietary L+1 layer). This design enables continued Moore's Law scaling through architectural innovation rather than transistor scaling alone.

## 1. Architecture Overview

### 1.1 Design Philosophy

The architecture is built on three foundational principles:

1. **Energy Proportionality**: Computational efficiency should scale with workload complexity
2. **Information Density**: Maximize bits per transistor and bits per joule
3. **Manufacturing Decoupling**: Separate computational design from process integration

### 1.2 The "4+1" Stack (As of Dec 2025)
