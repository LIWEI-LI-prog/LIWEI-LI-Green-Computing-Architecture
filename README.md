## 🎯 Executive Summary

The computing industry faces an existential crisis: AI data centers are projected to consume 20% of global electricity by 2030, while Moore's Law has reached its physical limits. 

**LIWEI LI Green Computing Architecture** presents a fundamental paradigm shift—moving beyond binary von Neumann architectures to achieve:

- **8-15× improvement in computational energy efficiency**
- **3-5× increase in compute density**  
- **Sustainable scaling** of global computational capabilities
