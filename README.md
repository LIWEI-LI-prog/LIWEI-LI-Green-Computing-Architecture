**A revolutionary open-source computing architecture leveraging ternary logic and photonic interconnects to break through energy and bandwidth walls.**

---

## 🚀 The Vision

We envision a future where powerful computational capacity is as accessible, affordable, and environmentally sustainable as water and electricity.

## 💡 Core Innovation: "4+1" Architecture

### 🧠 Ternary Computing
- **What**: Three-state logic (-1, 0, +1) beyond traditional binary
- **Why**: Higher information density, reducing computational complexity
- **Example**: Ternary full adder uses 37.5% fewer gates

### 🔦 Photonic Interconnects  
- **What**: Using light instead of electricity for data movement
- **Why**: Eliminates "memory wall" and "bandwidth wall"
